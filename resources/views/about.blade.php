  <h1>about</h1>

  
  <p>
    Poi is such a fringe activity, which is one of the things that makes it cool. But sadly, this "fringeness" can make it difficult to always
    find someone IRL (In Real Life) to teach you poi. Also you might not always be feeling, let's just say "creative" enough,
    to figure out tricks and new movements on your own. Luckily we live in the age of Youtube!
  </p>
  <p>
    This site was created with the mission of being a centralized rePoisatory of poi tricks and their accompanying Youtube lessons. If you know of tricks
    and/or videos that aren't listed on this site, please contact me and let me know! I know I have probably missed a lot,
    I am a novice poi spinner myself.

      Special shout outs to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/TaoAvatar20" target= "blank">DrexFactor Poi</a> and 
      <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/meenik" target= "blank">playpoi</a> who are like the GodFathers of poi 
      video lessons. The wealth of content they've created is amazing.
